## **Research Question**

> **How accurately can we predict 2023–2024 residential sale prices in
> Philadelphia using property characteristics and
> neighborhood/contextual features, in order to improve the city's
> automated property tax assessment model?**

### **Why This Matters**

-   **More accurate assessments** -\> fairer taxes and fewer disputes.
-   **Neighborhood and spatial insights** capture real market dynamics
    beyond building features.
-   **Transparent and data-driven modeling** builds trust and
    accountability in city governance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Data Overview**

### **Our Data Foundation**

-   **Philadelphia Property Sales (2023–2024)**\
    Over **17,200 residential transactions** citywide capturing sale
    price, location, and property structural details.

-   **Neighborhood & Contextual Data**\
    Combined city (OpenDataPhilly) and census (ACS 2023) information on:

    -   **Demographics:** race, household income, employment, education
    -   **Public safety:** proximity to violent and petty crime
    -   **Accessibility:** transit stops, bike lanes
    -   **Amenities & services:** parks, schools, hospitals, fire
        department, food retail

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What Do Home Prices Look Like?**

![Histogram of Sale Prices](histo.png){width="75%" align="center"}

**Key Findings**

-   Most homes sell for **under \$400,000**.\
-   A small number of **luxury properties** push up the high end.\
-   Reflects **strong housing inequality** across neighborhoods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Where Are Expensive Homes?**

**Key Findings:**

-   Center City and Northwest Philadelphia are **highest-value
    clusters**.\
-   River Wards and University City show **emerging appreciation**.\
-   North Philadelphia shows predominantly **lower-priced housing**.\

## **Neighborhood & Home Prices?**

Neighborhood](bubble.png){width="100%" align="center"}

**Key Findings:**

-   **Neighborhood wealth** remains a dominant factor in home values.
-   **Low-income, high-poverty** neighborhoods continue to see limited
    appreciation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Does Model Performance Improve?

| Model             | CV RMSE | R²       |
|-------------------|---------|----------|
| Structural Only   | 136,121 | 0.67     |
| Spatial           | 108,112 | 0.79     |
| **Fixed Effects** | 93,038  | **0.85** |
| **Hyper-model**   | 64,974  | **0.92** |

**Bottom Line**\
Each additional data layer improves accuracy, with neighborhood /
market-value features producing the largest jump (lowest RMSE and
highest R²).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What Drives the Improvement?**

-   From taking into accounts only the structural/building quality
    variables in our first model;
-   **Adding Spatial Data** accounts for proximity to parks, public
    schools, food retail, and violent crime.
-   **Adding Census & Socioeconomic Context** captures income,
    education, and housing quality.\
-   **Adding Neighborhood Fixed Effects** controls for unobserved local
    traits.\
-   **Grouping Small Neighborhoods** stabilizes estimates where data are
    sparse (sales\<10).
-   **Including Market Value Benchmarks** aligns predictions with
    broader price trends.

**Takeaway:**\
Philadelphia’s housing market is highly localized — accuracy improves
most when models reflect neighborhood structure and market context. The
Hyper model which optimized by groups small neighborhoods, is more
parsimonious while maintaining high predictive performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Best Models**

| Model                  | RMSE (\$) | R²   |
|------------------------|-----------|------|
| Model 3: Fixed Effects | \$93,038  | 0.85 |
| Model 4: Hyper Model   | \$64,974  | 0.92 |

Both models capture **structural**, **spatial**, **census**, and
**socioeconomic** factors,\
while incorporating **neighborhood effects** to reflect local market
variation.

**Key Insight:**\
Adding small-neighborhood grouping and market value signals delivers a
major leap in accuracy — boosting R² from 0.85 → 0.93. By going down to
the block level, our model captures fine-grained local variation,
showing that neighborhood and market context are essential for fair
property assessments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Key Findings**

**Top Predictors**

-   Neighborhoods (Prestige/unobserved characteristics)
-   Market Value

**Interesting Effects**

-   Higher % Black in the tract is associated with lower sale prices,
    holding all else constant.
-   Higher % age 65+ (more seniors) is associated with higher sale
    prices.
-   Violent incidents within \~600 feet of the home are associated with
    lower sale prices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Hardest To Predict**

![Visualization of Residual by Neighborhood](residuals.png){width="75%"
align="center"}

-   Residuals are calculated as actual price minus predicted price.
-   Downtown neighborhoods tend to have under predicted values, while
    suburban areas show over predicted values

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Policy Recommendations**

**Key Actions**

-   Lending and rehab programs should include an equity adjustment so
    borrowers in historically underpriced Black areas can actually
    access capital.
-   Keep long-term older homeowners in place with repair help and tax
    relief, because neighborhood stability itself raises surrounding
    home values.
-   Never deploy pricing algorithms like this for taxes or loan caps
    without a bias check; the model should be used to monitor inequity,
    not lock it in.
-   Fund repairs and upgrades for small owners in undervalued areas —
    not just in already-rich areas — so families who maintain their
    homes can actually build wealth.
-   Use models like this as a bias check — not to set taxes or loan
    limits directly, but to detect where the market may be undervaluing
    certain neighborhoods so policy can respond.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Limitations & Next Steps**

**Limitations**

-   **Data coverage:** After cleaning, the dataset dropped from \~24K to
    \~17K sales; if removals weren’t random, the model may overrepresent
    “normal” transactions and underrepresent edge cases.
-   **Lagged timing:** A single nearby incident doesn’t instantly cut
    value; what matters is a sustained history of violence that shapes
    how buyers perceive safety and status on that block.
-   **Interior detail:** We can’t actually see renovation quality
    (finishes, systems, upgrades), so the “interior condition” label is
    coarse — and assessed market value is likely soaking up a lot of
    that missing nuance.

**Next Steps**

-   Incorporate Spatial Models: Explore **spatial regression** and
    **spatial lag models** to better capture location-based dependencies
    and spatial effects on housing prices.
-   Field Validation & Data Enrichment: Conduct **field surveys** and
    integrate **cross-validated dataset** to assess model and ensure
    predictions accurately reflect real market conditions.
