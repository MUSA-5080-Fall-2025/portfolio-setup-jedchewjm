## Project Title: Mixed by Design

### *A Case Study of the Philadelphia Housing Authority's (PHA) Choice Neighborhoods Redevelopment of Sharswood*

For my Urban Studies thesis, I am researching the PHA's Choice Neighborhoods
redevelopment of the Sharswood neighborhood in North Philadelphia. I have two
main research questions about the process and outcome of this redevelopment:

\(1\) the **process** by which the PHA aligned the politics, finance, and design
for the redevelopment of Sharswood; and 

\(2\) the early redevelopment **outcomes** relative to the Choice Neighborhoods
Initiative (CNI) vision of mixed-partners, mixed-use, and mixed-income

## Part 1: Raw Data from Data Axle

**Data Axle Reference Solutions** (formerly ReferenceUSA and Infogroup) is a big
data, analytics, and marketing services provider that delivers best in class
data-driven, customer-centric technology solutions. It offers two main types of
data:

-   **Residential Historic Data:** Analyze community growth and general
    population differences.

-   **Historic Business Data:** Analyze market trends, economic growth, or
    specific industries. Access categories including Company Name, Geocodes,
    SIC/NAICS codes, Census Tracts.

I retrieved my raw data files from Data Axle through Penn Libraries and Wharton
Research and Data Services (WRDS) on October 15, 2025. The interface of Data
Axle is shown below.

### Record Types

-   **Verified Records:** have been verified by DataAxle staff through various
    compilation processes including phone validation

-   **Unverified Records:** separate database from verified records because of
    one of the following three reasons:

    -   records appear within data sources but have yet to be fully verified

    -   partial information is contained in the record, but not all data
        elements are present to be considered 'verified' at the point of data
        retrieval

    -   addresses are unverified (e.g. a business may have moved)

#### Step 1: Load Raw Data as csv files

-   DataAxle's U.S. Businesses Data Dictionary

-   Verified Businesses in Sharswood Neighborhood

-   Unverified Businesses in Sharswood Neighborhood

-   Philadelphia census tracts and neighborhood boundaries

#### Step 2: Get Philadelphia Demographic Data using `tidycensus`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load all available variables for ACS 5-year 2022

# Helper Variable for Summing Population Values for Elderly Population
elderly_pop = c("B01001_020", "B01001_021", "B01001_022", "B01001_023", 
                "B01001_024", "B01001_025",

                "B01001_047", "B01001_048", "B01001_049")

# Get tract-level demographic data from 2022 ACS 5-Yr Estimates for Philadelphia
phl_tract_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    total_pop = "B01003_001",
    child_pop = child_pop,
    elderly_pop = elderly_pop,

#### Step 3: Make Data Axle dataset Spatial

```{r}
# Convert Data Axle dataset to sf object
verified.sf <- verified_clean |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) |> # WGS 84 
  st_transform(2272) # PA State Plane (in US Survey Feet)

unverified.sf <- unverified_clean |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) |> 
  st_transform(2272)
```

**Join Data Axle Shapefiles to Philadelphia Census Tracts and Block Groups**

```{r}
# Filter Census Tracts for Sharswood
sharswood_tract_sf <- phl_tract_summary |> 
  filter(tract_name == c("138", "139"))

ggplot(sharswood_tract_sf) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void()

sharswood_tract <- sharswood_tract_sf |> 
  st_drop_geometry()
sharswood_tract

# Create CSV File
write_csv(sharswood_tract, "data/Sharswood_Tracts.csv")
```

```{r}
# Filter Block Groups for Sharswood

         "421010139002","421010139003")

sharswood_bg_sf <- block_grps |>
 filter(GEOID %in% ids)

ggplot(sharswood_bg_sf) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void()

  st_drop_geometry()
sharswood_bg

```

```{r}
# Join Shapefiles and Plot Map
sharswood_bg_sf <- st_transform(sharswood_bg_sf, st_crs(verified.sf))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sharswood_bg_sf, fill = "gray97", color = "gray50", linewidth = 0.3) +
  geom_sf(data = verified.sf, aes(fill = primary_sic_description), shape = 21, size = 2, alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(

    subtitle = "PA South State Plane (ftUS)",
    caption = paste0("CRS: ", st_crs(block_grps)$input %||% st_crs(block_grps)$epsg)
  ) +
  theme_void()

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sharswood_bg_sf, fill = "gray97", color = "gray50", linewidth = 0.3) +
  geom_sf(data = unverified.sf, shape = 21, size = 2, fill = "black", alpha = 0.9) +
