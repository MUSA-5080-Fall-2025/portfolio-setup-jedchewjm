## Project Title: Mixed by Design – A Case Study of the Philadelphia Housing Authority's (PHA) Choice Neighborhoods Redevelopment of Sharswood

For my Urban Studies thesis, I am researching the PHA's Choice Neighborhoods
redevelopment of the Sharswood neighborhood in North Philadelphia. I have two
main research questions about the process and outcome of this redevelopment:

\(1\) the **process** by which the PHA aligned the politics, finance, and design
for the redevelopment of Sharswood; and 

\(2\) the early redevelopment **outcomes** relative to the Choice Neighborhoods
Initiative (CNI) vision of mixed-partners, mixed-use, and mixed-income

## Part 1: Raw Data from Data Axle

**Data Axle Reference Solutions** (formerly ReferenceUSA and Infogroup) is a big
data, analytics, and marketing services provider that delivers best in class
data-driven, customer-centric technology solutions. It offers two main types of
data:

-   **Residential Historic Data:** Analyze community growth and general
    population differences.

-   **Historic Business Data:** Analyze market trends, economic growth, or
    specific industries. Access categories including Company Name, Geocodes,
    SIC/NAICS codes, Census Tracts.

I retrieved my raw data files from Data Axle through Penn Libraries and Wharton
Research and Data Services (WRDS) on October 15, 2025. The interface of Data
Axle is shown below.

### Record Types

-   **Verified Records:** have been verified by DataAxle staff through various
    compilation processes including phone validation

-   **Unverified Records:** separate database from verified records because of
    one of the following three reasons:

    -   records appear within data sources but have yet to be fully verified

    -   partial information is contained in the record, but not all data
        elements are present to be considered 'verified' at the point of data
        retrieval

    -   addresses are unverified (e.g. a business may have moved)

#### Step 1: Load Raw Data as csv files

-   DataAxle's U.S. Businesses Data Dictionary

-   Verified Businesses in Sharswood Neighborhood

-   Unverified Businesses in Sharswood Neighborhood

-   Philadelphia census tracts and neighborhood boundaries

## Part 3: Open Data Philly

Choose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.

**My Chosen Question: School Access and School Choice in City of Philadelphia**

-   **Data**: Schools, Census Tracts (race/income demographics)
    -   School Parcels: <https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/schools-parcels/> –
        parcel location of schools in the City of Philadelphia with attribute
        information for address, grade level, type, and status
    -   Schools: <https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/schools/> – points
        identifying public schools, charter schools, many private schools,
        school annexes, and athletic fields and facilities
-   **Question:** "Is lack of school access associated with vulnerable
    populations?"
-   **Operations:**
    -   Clean datasets
    -   Distance to nearest school
    -   Buffer schools (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile)
    -   Compare types and enrollment of schools by demographics
